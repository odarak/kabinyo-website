        <p>McDonald's typically bakes a variety of items, including their famous Apple Pie. It's a classic dessert option made with diced apples, cinnamon, and sugar, enclosed in a flaky pastry crust and baked to golden perfection. Depending on the location and menu offerings, they may also bake other items like cookies or muffins.</p>
